## Q: What is `Emmet`?
a: `Emmet` is a set of plug-ins for text editors that allows for high-speed coding and editing in HTML, XML, XSLT, and other structured code formats via content assist. 


## Q: what is Difference between `library and Framework`?
A: When you use a `library`, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a `framework`, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

## Q:What is `CDN`? Why do we `use` it?
A:A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications. CDN can stand for content delivery network or content distribution network. When a user visits a website, data from that website's server has to travel across the internet to reach the user's computer. If the user is located far from that server, it will take a long time to load a large file, such as a video or website image. Instead, the website content is stored on CDN servers geographically closer to the users and reaches their computers much faster.

## Why is a CDN `important`?
The primary purpose of a content delivery network (CDN) is to reduce latency, or reduce the delay in communication created by a network's design. Because of the global and complex nature of the internet, communication traffic between websites (servers) and their users (clients) has to move over large physical distances. The communication is also two-way, with requests going from the client to the server and responses coming back.

A CDN improves efficiency by introducing intermediary servers between the client and the website server. These CDN servers manage some of the client-server communications. They decrease web traffic to the web server, reduce bandwidth consumption, and improve the user experience of your applications.

 ## Q: Why is `React known as React`?

 1. React is a JavaScript library created by Facebook. Developers use it to build interactive user interfaces (UI) for websites and web applications. Think of it like the LEGO blocks for the web; with React, developers can create, combine, and reuse components (or blocks) to make beautiful, interactive web pages.

2. Reacting to Changes ‚ö°
Imagine you have a toy robot. Each time you press a button on the robot, it reacts and does something‚Äîlike moving its arm or lighting up its eyes. In a similar way, React allows web pages to ‚Äúreact‚Äù instantly to user actions without having to reload the entire page.

3. The Secret Behind the Magic: The Virtual DOM üé©
To understand why it‚Äôs called React, we must introduce a concept called the ‚ÄúVirtual DOM‚Äù (Document Object Model). Imagine the DOM as a big tree üå≤ of all the elements on a webpage. React, with its virtual DOM, finds and updates only the necessary parts, making websites faster and smoother.

4. Components: The Building Blocks üß±
React's name also reflects its approach to building UIs. In React, everything is made up of "components". A component could be a button, a menu, a picture, or even a whole section of a page. Just like you use toy parts to create figures, developers use components to create web pages.
